# Big Reveal URL Generator

This project contains a single-page HTML application for generating custom URLs for the **Big Reveal** marketing videos.

## Purpose

The generator allows marketing teams or event organizers to quickly compose a shareable link with predefined parameters. It provides a form where you can select various options such as headline text, fonts, and colors, then outputs a URL that encodes those choices. Sharing that URL lets anyone view the tailored Big Reveal animation without needing to edit any code by hand.
